Description: Describes spatial patterns of categorical raster data for 
    any defined regular and irregular areas. 
    Patterns are described quantitatively using built-in signatures 
    based on co-occurrence matrices but also allows for 
    any user-defined functions. 
    It enables spatial analysis such as search, change detection,
    and clustering to be performed on spatial patterns.
