The **motif** package describes spatial patterns of categorical raster data for any defined regular and irregular areas. 
Patterns are described quantitatively using built-in signatures based on co-occurrence matrices but also allows for any user-defined functions. 
It enables spatial analysis such as search, change detection, and clustering to be performed on spatial patterns.
